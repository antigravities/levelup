# Level Up

Level Up is a Steam game recommendations site where users can submit their own apps. It was originally designed for the /r/Steam Discord server.

## Try it

/r/Steam's copy of Level Up is available at https://recommendations.steamsal.es/.

## Run it yourself

### 1. using Docker

Make sure you have the .env file if not run: `cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env`

`docker build -t levelup .` 

`docker run --env-file .env -p 4000:4000 levelup` 

or

`docker run --env-file .env -p 4000:4000 bikerwhocodes/levelup` 

or

`docker-compose up`

or 

`docker-compose up -d` for headless mode

### 2. Natively

Level Up's server components are written in Go and operate on top of an Amazon DynamoDB database (DynamoDB's free tier is more than enough to host).

1. Download and install Go 1.14+.
2. Download and install Node.js + npm.
3. `cp .env.example .env && $EDITOR .env`
3. Start: `./ready.sh`, or
```sh
cd assets
webpack
cd ..

go build -i
./levelup
```

**Important:** In order to work as intended, Level Up unfortunately requires a US IP address. If you don't have one on your machine, launch Level Up in `fetch` mode using a US IP by running `./ready.sh fetch` (this will not start a Web server - launch levelup in `serve` mode similarly to the above to do that).
